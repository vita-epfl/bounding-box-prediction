# Pedestrian bounding box prediction library: <br/>
This library contains two research projects for bounding box predictions in 2D and 3D
---

The official code for two papers accepted in hEART (the Symposium of the European Association for Research in Transportation):


> __Pedestrian 3D Bounding Box Prediction, hEART 2022__<br /> 
>  S. Saadatnejad, Y. Ju, A. Alahi <br /> 
>  __[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10270)__ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __[Citation](https://github.com/vita-epfl/bounding-box-prediction#for-citation)__   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  __[Code](https://github.com/vita-epfl/bounding-box-prediction/tree/master/3D)__
     


> __Pedestrian Intention Prediction: A Multi-task Perspective, hEART 2020__<br /> 
> S. Bouhsain, S. Saadatnejad, A. Alahi <br /> 
> __[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10270)__ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __[Citation](https://github.com/vita-epfl/bounding-box-prediction#for-citation)__  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  __[Code](https://github.com/vita-epfl/bounding-box-prediction/tree/master/2D)__
     

These two codes will be merged soon to make a unified library.
